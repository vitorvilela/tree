# Hybrid Lagrangian tree-based-Eulerian framework
Adaptive, tree-based grid, 3D framework for flow simulations focused on particle transport

USES:

- Uthash: A hash table for C structures https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/

FEATURES:

- Adaptive grid
- MPI for distributed processing

TODO:

- Extend MPI to Euler fields and particle transport
- Add momentum transport
- Add particle transport
